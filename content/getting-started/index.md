## Requirements

- Abell requires [Node.js 10 or higher](https://nodejs.org) installed.
- Though it is not "required", if you're using VSCode, it is recommended to have [Abell Language Features Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saurabh.abell-language-features) for syntax highlighting of `.abell` files.

## Stuck?

- If you're stuck anywhere in the documentation, you can ask questions at [Abell's GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/abelljs/abell/discussions/categories/q-a)
